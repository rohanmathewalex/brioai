BrioAI - Transforming Content Interaction and Productivity with Smart AI Tools

## About Project

## Inspiration

The inspiration for BrioAI came from the daily struggle of processing vast amounts of content in a fast-paced digital world. As a professional who often deals with complex articles, documents, and multilingual communication, I realized there was a pressing need for a tool that simplifies content interaction, provides quick summaries, rewrites content for better clarity, and enables seamless communication across languages. Seeing how these challenges affect students, content creators, and professionals alike motivated me to create BrioAI — a solution to enhance productivity, bridge communication gaps, and make interacting with content smarter and more efficient.

## What it does

BrioAI is a web application designed to transform how users interact with content by offering:

- **Content Summarization**: Quickly distill long articles, documents, or user-provided text into concise and clear summaries.
- **Content Rewriting**: Generate alternative versions of text, optimizing for clarity, readability, or specific goals such as engagement or SEO.
- **Dynamic Prompt Generation**: Provide context-based prompts for creative ideation, task brainstorming, and content suggestions.
- **Multilingual Translation**: Facilitate accurate translations across different languages to enable effective communication for global users.

BrioAI empowers users to manage their content efficiently, improve their communication, and save valuable time.

## How we built it

BrioAI is built using a combination of modern web technologies:

- **Frontend**: Developed using React.js with Material-UI for a clean and responsive user interface that ensures a seamless experience.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Node.js and Express.js for managing user interactions, API calls, and data storage.
- **Data Management**: MongoDB is used as the database for storing user preferences, history, and data securely.
- **Chrome Built-in AI APIs**: Core functionalities such as summarization, rewriting, prompts, and translations are powered by Chrome’s built-in AI APIs for efficient, in-browser processing.
